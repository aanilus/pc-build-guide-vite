Not all parts are universal, not all parts are interchangeable. (I.E. An AMD AM4 CPU is not compatible with an AMD AM5 socket motherboard). For the sake of simplicity and budget, I will not include NAS server specific items. NAS component recommendations (This might differ for work rigs, gaming rigs, etc..):</p><ol><li>Power Supply (PSU): ◦ Any PSU can work as long as it’s at least 650+. I recommend Gold or Platinum for efficiency and full modular for cable management and ease of access, also enables you to add expansion cards in the future. ◦ Personal choice: Seasonic FOCUS GX-850 80+ Gold</li><li>CPU (Processor): ◦ Intel Core i5-13600K: High performance for value, unlocked CPU with quick sync capability. OC potential. ◦ AMD Ryzen 7 3700X: Great choice for NAS, very fast core speeds. Downside: no quick sync. ◦ Intel Core i5-8600k: Budget choice, will work well in a low traffic NAS server. With quick sync.</li><li>CPU Cooler: ◦ Personal choice: Noctua NH-U12S or NH-L12S (for compact builds): The best brand for air cooling, Noctua. ◦ Budget choice: Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo Do not fall into temptation of buying an AIO system (liquid cooler) for a NAS server. Reliability and longevity is what we want. Air coolers last longer with only basic maintenance.</li><li>RAM (Memory): ◦ Dependant on the motherboard/CPU we want either DDR4(Intel i5-8600k, Ryzen 7) or DDR5(i5-13600k) ram. Clock and latency isn’t as important in a NAS server. Finding ECC ram is the best, but the system needs to be built around that. For ease of use, a non ECC ram system will work fine in most cases. Anything above 3200 clock and below CL40 will work. ◦ Personal Choice: Corsair, or TeamGroup (Min. 32GB, 2x16, or 4x8)</li><li>Storage Drives (HDDs for NAS): You will need an identical sized parity drive (if your highest array drive is 8TB, you also need a 2nd 8TB for your parity. We will ignore the optional need for a cache drive for now. ◦ 2x Western Digital Red 8TB: Designed for NAS systems, more expensive than others. ◦ 2x Seagate IronWolf 8TB: Reliable, more expensive than others, made for high volume read/writes. ◦ 2x Seagate Compute 8TB: Reliable, not expensive, fast transfers (read/write), high life cycle.</li><li>Motherboard: ◦ MSI MAG B660 TOMAHAWK: Good for Intel builds (LGA1700, i5-13600k) ◦ ASUS ROG Strix B450-F: Good for AMD builds (AM4, Ryzen 7 3700x)</li><li>*OPTIONAL Graphics: *If you get a quick sync capable CPU then this component is unnecessary: • NVIDIA GTX 1650: Most affordable choice. • NVIDIA RTX 3060: Much higher transcode speeds *Keep in mind that rig cases are not universal, they are dependant on the components, more specifically on the motherboard and PSU chosen.</li></ol>',3)]))}const m=a(i,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
