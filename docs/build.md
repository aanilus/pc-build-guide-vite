# Build
## II: PSU
1. Place the PSU in the designated area of your case (either top or bottom, depending on case
   design). Ensure the fan faces the correct direction for ventilation (Usually you can determine the
   orientation by where the ventilation grill is on the case)
2. Secure the PSU: Align the PSU with the mounting holes and screw it in place. Tighten securely but don’t over-tighten.
## III: Install the Motherboard
1. Make sure the standoffs (Pins with mounting holes where motherboard goes) are aligned
   correctly with the holes for your model of motherboard, you can verify the placements in your
   MB manual. Use pliers to take them off and move them as necessary.
2. Once opened: Carefully place the motherboard into the case without sliding or applying
   imbalanced pressure, align it with the standoffs (the centre standoff should keep it secure once
   it’s aligned and falls into place). Make sure the I/O panel is aligned with the rectangular hole on
   the back of the case.
3. Add the screws without over-tightening.
## IV: Install the CPU (Processor)
1. Open the CPU. Open the metal arm or tray on your motherboard (Usually a push-down pin).
   Look for a small triangle or dot on the corner of the socket and CPU chip and match them to
   align. There are also small notches in both the socket and chip to avoid misalignment, it
   should fall into place with zero pressure. Do not slide the CPU chip to turn it.
2. Install the CPU: Close the lever; on AMD sockets, this requires some force. On intel, it is
   generally easier to close and lock into place.
## V: Install RAM
1. Use your MB manual to find the preferred sockets if you’re only using 2 sticks (2x16
   configuration). Usually the slots are 2 & 4 (Looking at your motherboard left to right would be
   1 through 4). If you’re using a 4 stick configuration (4x8), simply install all of them.
2. Install the RAM: Open the locking pins (sometimes on both ends, sometimes only one end)
   Align the notches on the RAM sticks with the motherboard slots (On the RAM connector; one
   side is longer than the other). Once aligned, press down firmly on both ends until the RAM
   clicks into place. Close the locking pins. Make sure to press straight down to avoid breaking the
   connector.
## VI: Install the Storage Drives (HDDs or SSDs)
1. Mounting: Cases come with mounting areas for HDDs and SSDs, usually a tray type system,
   pull the tray out and mount the HDDs on it using the appropriate screws.
2. Connect Cables: Attach the power cables from the PSU and the data cables (SATA) from the
   motherboard to each drive. Make sure not to force them the wrong way. SATA cables click into
   place, power cables simply push in.
3. Put the tray back in position bringing the wires to the back for better management.
## VII: Install the CPU Cooler
1. Remove contents from the package and follow the instructions in the manual on the configuration of the mount depending on your CPU socket (AM4, LGA1700, etc.).
2. Once that’s figured out, apply the thermal paste on the back of the CPU. Do not apply too
   much. I suggest a small dot in each corner, and the centre.
