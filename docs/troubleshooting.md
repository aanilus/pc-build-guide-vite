# Troubleshooting

Step by step build
 
## Case
Your case will hold all the parts of the build. There is a safe and logical order that can be followed for a better building experience.

### PSU
The first part is the PSU. Before fixing it to the case, make sure you have all the required wires (to the cpu, the hard drives and the motherboard). It might be difficult to plug them in once the PSU is fixed to the case.

### Motherboard
The next part is the motherboard. The steps toinstalling a motherboard are as follows:
- screw standoffs into the case
- place the motherboard on the standoffs
- screw the motherboard into the standoffs

Be careful not to slide the motherboard around on the standoffs as this can cause damage.

## CPU
Install the CPU on the motherboard (see [build](build.md) page)

## RAM
Install the RAM on the motherboard (see [build](build.md) page)
 
## Storage drives
Install the storage drives on the motherboard (see [build](build.md) page)
